# Libfabric Communication Library @ HotI 2025

<!-- # Libfabric Tutorial   -->
<!-- **HOTI 2025** -->


## Abstract

Libfabric supports multiple communication semantics, is fabric and hardware implementation agnostic, and leverages and expands the existing RDMA open source community. Libfabric is designed to minimize the impedance mismatch between applications, including middleware such as MPI, SHMEM, CCL, etc.

This tutorial focuses on new features like the link provider bridging different providers, and the usage of this new link provider. 

We will also focus on updates with UltraEthernet and Libfabric.
