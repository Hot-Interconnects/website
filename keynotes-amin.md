**Title:** Now in Focus: the Fifth, GenAI Epoch of Computing Infrastructure

**Abstract:** Amin Vahdat VP/GM of AI & Infrastructure at Google, will examine the evolution of computing infrastructure, from its transformation for internet service delivery to the modern-day revolution driven by genAI. Amin explores the design principles behind scale-out architectures and the shift towards specialized hardware, high-bandwidth networks, liquid cooling and advanced memory technologies necessitated by genAI. Taken together, these shifts promise to render next-generation unrecognizable relative to today’s conventional wisdom with orders of magnitude improvement in compute capacity, scalability, and power efficiency.
