## The 32nd IEEE Symposium on High-Performance Interconnects, Hot Interconnects (HotI 2025), will take place virtually from Wednesday, August 20 – Friday, August 22, 2025

IEEE Hot Interconnects is the premier international forum for researchers and developers of state-of-the-art hardware and software architectures and implementations for interconnection networks of all scales, ranging from multi-core, on-chip interconnects to those within systems, clusters, data centers, and clouds. This yearly conference is attended by leaders in industry and academia.

* System-on-Chip Interconnects 
* Chiplet-interconnect technologies such as UCIe and BOW
* Advanced chip-to-chip communication technologies 
* Optical interconnects 
* Protocol and interfaces for inter-processor communication
* Survivability and fault-tolerance of interconnects 
* High-speed packet processing engines and network processors 
* System and storage area network architectures and protocols
* High-performance host-network interface architectures 
* High-bandwidth and low-latency I/O 
* Pb/s switching and routing technologies 
* Innovative architectures for supporting collective communication 
* Novel communication architectures to support cloud & grid computing 
* Centralized and distributed cloud interconnects

Interconnect Software: You can't touch it but you need it</strong>
</div>
The latest advancements in photonics, chips, parallel paths, and other cutting-edge interconnect technologies are dazzling. However, the picture is incomplete without the system software needed to exploit their full potential. This edition of Hot Interconnects will explore the underlying software ecosystems that empower interconnect fabrics to support a wide array of applications.

## Paper Format

This year we invite papers to be submitted either as regular (long) papers (up to 10 pages) or as hot topic papers (up to 4 pages). Hot topic papers could be positional papers, industry papers, or papers describing hot-off-the-press breaking research results and will be judged accordingly and independently from the regular papers.

* Papers need sufficient technical detail to judge quality and suitability for presentation. Submissions must conform to <a href="https://conferences.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/author-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-policies/">[IEEE ethics standards]</a>
* Submissions should include title, author, abstract, and paper in double-column, see <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">[IEEE format]</a> for details.
* Papers will be submitted electronically through <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=hoti2025"> [EasyChair] </a> and will undergo a single-blind review process.
* Regular papers: up to 10 pages (including technical content and figures), excluding references and any appendices. Appendices (if any) are limited to 5 pages (the limit might be extended upon committee approval in advance). Reproducibility appendices are encouraged but no official verification is provided by the HotI program committee.
* Hot topic papers: up to 4 pages (including technical content and figures) excluding references. Appendices are not allowed for hot topic papers.
* Materials other than the abstract, main paper body, and references will be read at the committee’s discretion.
* Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xplore’s scope and quality requirements. We plan to invite the best papers for an <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=40">[IEEE Micro]</a> Special issue submission.
* After a paper is accepted, the authors must follow the conference and <a href="https://www.computer.org/conferences/cps"> [IEEE CPS guidelines]</a> in publishing the paper.
<!-- ## Posters and Tutorials -->

<!-- We are also inviting tutorial submissions. More information regarding poster will come out soon.  -->
<!-- [The call for tutorials is now out](call-for-tutorials.html). -->

## Best Papers

High impact papers will be considered for “Best Industry Paper” (primary author(s) from industry) and “Best Academic Paper” (primary author(s) from academia or non-profit research laboratories) categories.
 
2024 Hot Interconnects best papers:
 
[Best Industry Paper] Unified Collective Communication (UCC): A Unified Library for CPU, GPU, and DPU Collectives (*Ferrol Aderholdt, Manjunath Gorentla Venkata, Valentine Petrov, Sergey Lebedev, Devendar Bureddy, Joshua Ladd, Gil Bloch, Mike Dubman, and Gilad Shainer*) <[hyperlink to IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10664373)>
 
[Best Academic Paper] A New Mechanism to Identify Congesting Packets in High-Performance Interconnection Networks (*Cristina Olmedilla, Jesus Escudero-Sahuquillo, Pedro Javier Garcia, Francisco J. Quiles, Wenhao Sun, Long Yan, Yunping Lyu, and Jose Duato*) <[hyperlink to IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10664227)>

## Safety and Well-being

Given the success of previous year’s online format, Hot Interconnects 2025 will continue to be an online conference.
