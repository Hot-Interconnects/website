## 2025 Conference Theme - Interconnect Software: You can't touch it but you need it

The latest advancements in photonics, chips, parallel paths, and other cutting-edge interconnect technologies are dazzling. However, the picture is incomplete without the system software needed to exploit their full potential. This edition of Hot Interconnects will explore the underlying software ecosystems that empower interconnect fabrics to support a wide array of applications.

## Process

This year we invite papers to be submitted either as regular, long papers (6-8 pages) or as hot topic papers (3-4 pages). Hot topic papers could be positional papers, industry papers, or papers describing hot-off-the-press breaking research results, and will be judged accordingly and independently from the regular long papers.

* Papers need sufficient technical detail to judge quality and suitability for presentation. Submissions must conform to <a href="https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/ethical-requirements/">[IEEE ethics standards]</a>
* Submissions should include title, author, abstract, and paper in double-column, see <a href="https://www.ieee.org//conferences/publishing/templates.html">[IEEE format]</a> for details.
* Regular/Long paper limit: 6-8 pages, single-spaced, 2 columns, excluding references.
* Hot topic paper limit: 3-4 pages, single-spaced, 2 columns, including references.
* Accepted papers (both long and hot topic papers) will be published in IEEE Xplore Digital Library. <span style="color: #FF0000">IEEE Micro?</span>
* Papers should be submitted electronically through EasyChair <span style="color: #FF0000">Link To be updated</span>

We will be offering a best paper award this year.

## Posters and Tutorials

We are also inviting tutorial submissions. More information regarding poster will come out soon. 
<!-- [The call for tutorials is now out](call-for-tutorials.html). -->

## Safety and Well-Being

Given the success of previous yearâ€™s online format, Hot Interconnects 2025 will continue to be an online conference.
