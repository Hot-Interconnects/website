# Call For Papers
HotI 2026 solicits original research papers addressing the design, analysis, implementation, and evaluation of high-performance interconnects and closely related technologies. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, interconnect architectures, network protocols, networking software, communication runtimes, congestion control, optical and emerging fabrics, accelerator and chiplet interconnects, disaggregated systems, and system–network co-design. 

Paper submissions are expected to open in March 2026. Like the previous years, we will consider regular and hot-topic papers. The full Call for Papers, including important dates and submission guidelines, will be released closer to the submission opening.

<!-- ## The 33rd IEEE Symposium on High-Performance Interconnects, Hot Interconnects (HotI 2026), will take place virtually

IEEE Hot Interconnects is the premier international forum for researchers and developers of state-of-the-art hardware and software architectures and implementations for interconnection networks of all scales, ranging from multi-core, on-chip interconnects to those within systems, clusters, data centers, and clouds. This yearly conference is attended by leaders in industry and academia.

## Paper Format
TBD

This year we invite papers to be submitted either as regular (long) papers (up to 10 pages) or as hot topic papers (up to 4 pages). Hot topic papers could be positional papers, industry papers, or papers describing hot-off-the-press breaking research results and will be judged accordingly and independently from the regular papers.

* Papers need sufficient technical detail to judge quality and suitability for presentation. Submissions must conform to <a href="https://conferences.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/author-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-policies/">[IEEE ethics standards]</a>
* Submissions should include title, author, abstract, and paper in double-column, see <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">[IEEE format]</a> for details.
* Papers will be submitted electronically through EasyChair (link TBD) and will undergo a single-blind review process.
* Regular papers: up to 10 pages (including technical content and figures), excluding references and any appendices. Appendices (if any) are limited to 5 pages (the limit might be extended upon committee approval in advance). Reproducibility appendices are encouraged but no official verification is provided by the HotI program committee.
* Hot topic papers: up to 4 pages (including technical content and figures) excluding references. Appendices are not allowed for hot topic papers. Hot topic papers should describe initial research or early first-of-a-kind results (from industry or academia) and will be reviewed independently from the regular papers. Hot topic papers will not be considered for IEEE Micro special issue.
* Materials other than the abstract, main paper body, and references will be read at the committee’s discretion.
* Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xplore’s scope and quality requirements. We plan to invite regular papers with the highest review scores for an <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=40">[IEEE Micro]</a> Special issue submission.
* After a paper is accepted, the authors must follow the conference and <a href="https://www.computer.org/conferences/cps"> [IEEE CPS guidelines]</a> in publishing the paper. 
## Posters and Tutorials 

We are also inviting tutorial submissions. More information regarding poster will come out soon. 
[The call for tutorials is now out](call-for-tutorials.html).

## Best Papers

High impact papers will be considered for “Best Industry Paper” (primary author(s) from industry) and “Best Academic Paper” (primary author(s) from academia or non-profit research laboratories) categories.
 
2025 Hot Interconnects best papers:
 
**[Best Industry Paper]** Accelerating Frontier MoE Training with 3D Integrated Optics (*Taylor Groves, Mikhail Bernadskiy, Ho John Lee, Peter Carson, Thomas Graham and Eric Yeh (Lightmatter)*) <[hyperlink to IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11244753)>
 
**[Best Academic Paper]** Deadlock-free routing for Full-mesh networks without using Virtual Channels (*Alejandro Cano Cos, Cristóbal Camarero, Carmen Martinez (Universidad de Cantabria) and Ramon Beivide (Universidad de Cantabria, Barcelona Supercomputing Center)*) <[hyperlink to IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11244771)>

## Safety and Well-being

Given the success of previous year’s online format, Hot Interconnects 2025 will continue to be an online conference.
