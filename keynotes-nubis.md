**Title:** Overcoming Operational Barriers to AI Scale-Up with Co-Packaged Optics Integration

**Abstract:** 
<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0em;">
AI scale-up remains constrained by the limited reach of passive copper interconnects at data rates of 200 Gbps per lane and higher. A promising approach involves leveraging existing co-packaged copper sockets to support plug-in compatible active copper and co-packaged optics modules. This strategy enables a flexible, mixed-media interconnect architecture that eliminates traditional reach limitations. By adopting this approach, operators can extend the AI scale-up domain across the data center while maintaining operational simplicity and benefiting from a multi-sourced, pluggable ecosystem.
