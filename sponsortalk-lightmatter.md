**Title:** Transforming AI Infrastructure with the Power of 3D Photonics

**Abstract:** 
<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0em;">
3D photonics’ edgeless I/O paradigm overcomes the reach and bandwidth limits of traditional interconnects, linking thousands of GPUs with unprecedented scale-up throughput and energy efficiency. This talk will unpack the enabling technologies—silicon photonics integration, 3D packaging and high-density laser arrays—that make faster, more efficient AI model training and next-generation data-center architectures possible.
