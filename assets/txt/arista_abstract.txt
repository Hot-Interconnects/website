Normalizing cloud connectivity across cloud providers
and bringing those constructs back to the existing
on-premises environment has proven to be a complex challenge
for many enterprises.  This session will discuss how standards-based
BGP/EVPN/IPSEC constructs can be used, in conjunction with
cloud-native declarative provisioning systems to enable
consistent network segmentation and abstractions across
diverse operating environments.

We will then discuss building on top of these a common
observability framework to enable distributed network sensor
capabilities that can be dynamically targeted for increased
capture fidelity against threats, anomalies, or as part of
targeted investigations.
