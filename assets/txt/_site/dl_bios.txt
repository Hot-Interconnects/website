high-performance file systems and storage, virtualization,
and cloud computing. He has published over 500 papers in major
journals and international conferences related to these research
areas. Dr. Panda and his research group members have been doing
extensive research on modern networking technologies including
InfiniBand, High-Speed Ethernet, RDMA over Converged Enhanced
Ethernet (RoCE), Omni-Path, and EFA. Dr. Panda and his team have
been actively working on high-performance MPI and PGAS libraries
(http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu), Deep Learning libraries
(http://hidl.cse.ohio-state.edu) and Big Data libraries
(http://hibd.cse.ohio-state.edu).  Dr. Panda has served (or serving)
as Program Chair/Co-Chair/Vice-Chair of many international
conferences. He is an IEEE Fellow and a member of ACM. More details

Arpan Jain received his B.Tech. and M.Tech. degrees in Information
Technology from ABV-IIITM, India. Currently, Arpan is working towards
his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State
University. His current research focus lies at the intersection of
High-Performance Computing (HPC) libraries and Deep Learning (DL)
frameworks. He is working on parallelization and distribution strategies
for large-scale Deep Neural Network (DNN) training. He previously worked
on speech analysis, time series modeling, hyperparameter optimization,
and object recognition. He actively contributes to projects like HiDL
(high-performance deep learning), MVAPICH2-GDR software, and LBANN deep
learning framework. He is a member of IEEE. More details about Arpan are

Dr. Aamir Shafi is currently a Research Scientist in the Department of
Computer Science & Engineering at the Ohio State University where he is
involved in the High Performance Big Data project led by Dr. Dhabaleswar
K. Panda. Dr. Shafi was a Fulbright Visiting Scholar at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) in the 2010-2011 academic year where he worked
with Prof. Charles Leiserson on the award-winning Cilk technology. Dr. Shafi
received his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Portsmouth, UK
in 2006. He got his Bachelors in Software Engineering degree from NUST,
Pakistan in 2003. Dr. Shafiâ€™s current research interests include architecting
robust libraries and tools for Big Data computation with emphasis on Machine
and Deep Learning applications. Dr. Shafi co-designed and co-developed a
Java-based MPI-like library called MPJ Express. More details about Dr. Shafi
are available from https://people.engineering.osu.edu/people/shafi.16.
