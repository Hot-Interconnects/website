Hari Subramoni received a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from The Ohio State
University, Columbus, OH, in 2013. He is a research scientist in the Department
of Computer Science and Engineering at the Ohio State University, USA, since Sept
2015. His research interests include high-performance interconnects and protocols,
parallel computer architecture, network-based computing, exascale computing, network
topology aware computing, QoS, power-aware LAN-WAN communication, fault tolerance,
virtualization, cloud computing, and deep learning. He has published over 70 papers
in international journals and conferences related to these research areas. He has
been actively involved in various professional activities in academic journals and
conferences. Recently, Dr. Subramoni is doing research and working on design and
development for MVAPICH2 (High-Performance MPI over InfiniBand, iWARP, and RoCE)
and MVAPICH2-X (Hybrid MPI and PGAS (OpenSHMEM and UPC)) software packages. More
