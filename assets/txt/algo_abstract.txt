By mapping algorithms into logic, network applications
can be implemented that perform full-stack processing
functions with very low latency. Whereas applications
written in software software typically require multiple
microseconds to complete application-level functions,
applications implemented in Field Programmable Gate Array
(FPGA) logic process packets of data on the timescale of
nanoseconds.  A challenge in the past has been that the
time to develop applications was typically measured in years.
But today, with the help of High Level Synthesis (HLS)
compilers and pre-built ultra-low-latency IP cores for
networking, Algo-Logic provides complete frameworks for
deploying applications for high-frequency trading, database,
and other real-time applications on multiple off-the-shelf
FPGA platforms from Intel, Xilinx, and Cisco.
