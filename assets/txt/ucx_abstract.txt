Over the past 10 years, the Unified Communication X (UCX) framework
has developed from an initial vision for a portable networking
middleware layer to a fully implemented framework specification that
supports multiple architectures including x86, Arm, Power and GPU.
UCX provides a high-performance stacked architecture for communication
runtimes like MPI and OpenSHMEM, and the definition of UCX protocol
and transport layers continue to evolve with the introduction of new
GPU supercomputers, edge computing devices, and smart networking cards. 

This tutorial covers some of the most recent advances around the UCX
ecosystem and provides meaningful examples of the usage of UCX with MPI,
OpenSHMEM, and as part of higher-level tools like NVIDIA's RAPIDS and
Apache Spark. In addition to understanding the latest support for UCX
layers, attendees will learn how to run simple examples of UCX codes
that are relevant for Python developers with PyUCX, traditional MPI and
SHMEM programmers.
