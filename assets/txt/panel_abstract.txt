SmartNICs and DPUs are separated from their generic counterparts
by their capability to dynamically load and execute programs,
enabling them to adapt to changing workloads. These NIC-based
applications can execute on classic Von Neumann-architecture CPUs
like ARM cores or be compiled into bitstreams that can then be
loaded into programmable logic. It is generally accepted that
programming for an ARM core is more straightforward than building
a bitstream for an FPGA. Conversely, programs manipulating integer
data, like that in a network packet flow, often produce results at
a significantly faster rate when using programmable logic versus
ARM cores. Today we have leaders from three of the most powerful
Von Neumann-architecture SmartNIC platforms: Marvell, NVIDIA, and
Pensando, as well as all three from the programmable-logic architecture
side: Achronix, Intel, and Xilinx. In the end, the market will
decide which architecture will rule the day, but until then, you
decide!
