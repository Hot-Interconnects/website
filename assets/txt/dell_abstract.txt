Take your datacenter from static to adaptive and autonomous
with Dell’s MX7000 and Liqid Matrix. Compose bare metal servers
on-demand to meet real-time business needs, all via software.
Eliminate costly overprovisioning by deploying only what’s needed
today. When more resources are needed, scale in seconds with
zero-touch. When workloads are retired, resources can be quickly
moved to those applications that need them most.

The kinetic architecture of Dell’s MX7000 and Liqid Matrix
allows you to disaggregate resources like compute, GPU, NVMe
flash, Intel® Optane™ memory, FPGAs and NICs into pools connected
via high-speed fabric. Then use software to compose them into
real-time IT solutions to quickly address today’s business
challenges.
