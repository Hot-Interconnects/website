**Title:** Building Custom AI Infrastructure with NVLink Fusion

**Abstract:** 
<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0em;">
Rack-scale infrastructure is essential for today’s large-scale AI deployments. As large language models (LLMs) grow in complexity, flexible systems must efficiently run both enormous individual models and coordinated sets of smaller models, such as Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures. The NVIDIA NVL72 GB300 —built with NVLink for scale-up and high-performance networking for scale-out—has become an industry standard. In this talk, we introduce NVLink Fusion: a new technology empowering hyperscalers to tailor both AI and compute subsystems, optimizing infrastructure for diverse workloads. We will demonstrate how NVLink Fusion extends the advantages of NVLink scale-up while integrating seamlessly with a robust partner ecosystem at the rack scale, ensuring performance and versatility for future AI demands.
