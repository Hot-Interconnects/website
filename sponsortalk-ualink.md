**Title:** Why UALink: A Protocol-Level Comparison for Rack-Scale AI

**Abstract:** 
<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0em;">
As AI workloads push the limits of system bandwidth and latency, the need for a purpose-built, memory-semantic fabric for scale-up AI connectivity becomes critical.
<br>
In this session, the UALink Consortium will explore how UALink is uniquely optimized for scale-up AI architecture, offering lower latency, higher efficiency, and native memory coherency for GPU-GPU communication. Attendees will gain insight into a technical comparison of UALink with Ethernet-based protocols and understand why UALink is emerging as the preferred fabric for next-generation open rack-scale AI infrastructure.
