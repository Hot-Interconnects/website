**Title:** Reimagining the Scale-Out Architecture for HPC and AI

**Abstract:** 
<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0em;">
High performance applications such as AI training, AI inference and HPC scientific modelling are all benefitting from the dramatic performance increases of CPUs, GPUs and other accelerators. These applications rely on massive parallelization, but in many cases, the scale-out, inter-node interconnect that parallelization relies upon is not up for the challenge, and becomes the primary bottleneck in the system. This leads to dramatic under-utilization of expensive assets, and is both a technical and business challenge.
<br>
There are several key metrics that determine how an interconnect will impact the performance of challenging applications including message rate, latency, bandwidth and speed of congestion management. In this talk, Matthew will dive into the differentiated Omni-Path architecture that embraces open standards and delivers industry-leading performance to our open ecosystem.
