**Title:** Evolving inter-connect fabric and SDN in the cloud to meet the needs of AI workloads

**Abstract:** 
<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0em;">
AI applications are demanding much higher scale, performance and security from the datacenter network. These applications are bandwidth hungry, needing to read/write large amounts of data from storage. They rely on GPUs that may be geographically distributed, including 3rd party GPUs in remote datacenters. The connectivity must be secured so that there is no risk of data leakage. In this talk, I will share how we are evolving the interconnect fabric and SDN stack in the cloud to meet these needs of AI workloads.
