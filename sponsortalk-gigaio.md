<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0em;">
Modern AI inference workloads require an efficient scale-up architecture to provide an exceptional user experience at high concurrent users.  GigaIO’s AI memory fabric uniquely addresses this need by providing industry-leading performance and unmatched versatility, supporting all accelerators equally well – including different brands (NVIDIA, AMD, TensTorrent, d-Matrix, and more), formats (PCIe card or UBB), and types (GPU, FPGA, ASIC). This talk will provide a concise overview of GigaIO’s AI memory architecture and highlight the key benchmarks demonstrating its performance advantages compared with alternative solutions.
