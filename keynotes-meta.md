Meta is building AI infrastructure at enormous scale to handle a large breadth of workloads, from Generative AI to Machine Learning. These workloads require innovation in compute, storage, power, and of course, networking. Meta continue to take great strides to innovate in this space including creating our own custom silicon, MTIA, to improve both performance and cost. In this talk, we will take a quick tour of the work going on at Meta and see the direction it is moving.
