  #abstract: "High-performance workloads demand heterogeneous processing, tiered memory architecture,
  #persistent memory support, infrastructure accelerators such as smart NICs, and infrastructure
  #processing units to meet the demands of the emerging compute landscape. Applications such as
  #Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Analytics, 5G, automotive, and high-performance computing
  #are driving significant change in infrastructure such as Cloud, Edge, and client computing. Interconnect is
  #a key pillar in this evolving computational landscape. The recent advent of Compute Express Link (CXL), a
  #new open standard for cache-coherent interconnect, with its memory and coherency semantics has
  #made it possible to pool computational and memory resources at the rack level using low-latency,
  #higher-throughput, and memory-coherent access mechanisms. CXL is adopting networking features such
  #as multi-host connectivity, pooled memory, persistence flows, and fabric manager while keeping its low-
  #latency load-store semantics intact. The load-store I/O interconnects such as PCI Express (PCIe) and CXL
  #are evolving to provide efficient access mechanisms across multiple nodes with advanced atomics,
  #acceleration, smart NICs, persistent memory support etc. In this talk we will explore how synergistic
  #evolution across load-store interconnects and fabrics can benefit the compute infrastructure of the
  #future."
