Selected papers from Last year's Hot Interconnects have been published in
the Hot Interconnects dedicated January/February issue of IEEE Micro: 

 https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazines/mi/2020/01

Hot Interconnects is the premier international forum for researchers and
developers of state-of-the-art hardware and software architectures and
implementations for interconnection networks of all scales, ranging from
multi-core on-chip interconnects to those within systems, clusters, data
centers, and clouds.  This yearly conference is attended by leaders in
industry and academia. The atmosphere provides for a wealth of
opportunities to interact with individuals at the forefront of this field.

Themes include cross-cutting issues spanning computer systems, networking
technologies, and communication protocols for high-performance
interconnection networks. This conference is directed particularly at new
and exciting technology and product innovations in these areas.
Contributions should focus on real experimental systems, prototypes, or
leading-edge products and their performance evaluation. In past year’s the
best papers on interconnect microarchitecture have been invited to submit
extended versions of their papers to special journal editions, we are
pursuing this once again this year.

Building on last year's successful technical program comprising keynotes,
technical sessions, and panels on networking for datacenters and
Edge computing, the 2020 edition of Hot Interconnects is
generously hosted by QCT at their campus in San Jose, CA.

This year's conference focuses on SmartNICs and their adoption and
use in traditional and non-traditional applications, such as 
Cloud computing. We hope you can join us there.

We invite paper submissions across a wide range of topics and levels,
ranging from fundamentals to the latest advances in hot topic areas.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Novel and innovative interconnect architectures 
* Multi-core processor interconnects 
* System-on-Chip Interconnects 
* Advanced chip-to-chip communication technologies 
* Optical interconnects Protocol and interfaces for inter-processor 
  communication 
* Survivability and fault-tolerance of inter-connects 
* High-speed packet processing engines and network processors 
* Systems software for communication
* System and storage area network architectures and protocols
* High-performance host-network interface architectures 
* High-bandwidth and low-latency I/O 
* Pb/s switching and routing technologies 
* Innovative architectures for supporting collective communication 
* Novel communication architectures to support cloud & grid computing 
* Centralized and distributed cloud interconnects 
* Requirements driving high-performance interconnects
* Traffic characterization for HPC systems and commercial data centers
* Software-defined networking and software overlay networks
* Software for network bring-up, configuration and performance management 
  (OpenFlow, OpenSM)
* Data Center Networking

SCHEDULE AND SUBMISSION PROCEDURE:

* Paper abstract deadline:         May 8th, 2020  
* Submission deadline:            May 15th, 2020 
* Notification of acceptance:   June 19th, 2020 
* Symposium:                    August 19-20, 2020
* Tutorials:                              August 21, 2020

This year we invite papers to be submitted either as regular, long papers
(6-8 pages) or as hot topic papers (3-4 pages). Hot topic papers could be
positional papers, industry papers, or papers describing hot-off-the-press
breaking research results, and will judged accordingly and independently
from the regular long papers.

* Papers need sufficient technical detail to judge quality and
  suitability for presentation.
* Submissions should include title, author, abstract, and paper in 
  double-column, IEEE format.
* Long paper limit: 8 pages, single-spaced, 2 columns.  
* Hot topic paper limit: 4 pages, single-spaced, 2 columns.  
* Papers should be submitted electronically through EasyChair at 
  
  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hoti27​ 

* Paper title and abstract should be submitted by May 8th. * Full paper manuscript should be submitted by May 15th. * Accepted papers (both long and hot topic papers) will be published in proceedings by the IEEE Computer Society.

POSTERS

We are also inviting poster abstract submissions. Abstracts will consist
of a one page description of the proposed poster and should highlight 
technical merit, relevance to HotI, and novelty of the content. Additionally,
abstracts should include title and author information.  Selected 
submissions will be invited to present their work in poster format during
the poster session. Posters should be 32x40 inches (or 80x100cm) with a 
vertical/portrait layout.

POSTER SCHEDULE:

* Early poster abstract deadline:                  June 8th, 2020 
* Early poster notification of acceptance:   June 15th, 2020
* Final poster abstract deadline:                  July 13th, 2020 
* Final poster notification of acceptance:     July 20th, 2020
