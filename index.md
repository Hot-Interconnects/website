    <strong>2025 Conference Theme<br>
    Interconnect Software: You can't touch it but you need it</strong>
    </div>

    The latest advancements in photonics, chips, parallel paths, and other cutting-edge interconnect technologies are dazzling. However, the picture is incomplete without the system software needed to exploit their full potential. This edition of Hot Interconnects will explore the underlying software ecosystems that empower interconnect fabrics to support a wide array of applications.

## HotI32 (2025) Overview

{% comment %}
#Due to continued uncertainty around the spread of COVID-19, there will not be an in-person event for Hot Interconnects 28, but it will be held as an on-line virtual conference. All tutorials, keynotes, and sessions will be broadcast  so that all registered conference attendees will be able to access. Logon instructions will be emailed to all  attendees before the start of the conference. The broadcast will be in the Pacific Time Zone.  Per-talk Slack channels connect you to presenters for live Q&A and discussions with other attendees.  We hope that you enjoy this new format conference and all the interesting presentations described here.

IEEE Hot Interconnects is the premier international forum for researchers
and developers of state of the art hardware and software architectures and
implementations for interconnection networks of all scales, ranging from
multi-core on-chip interconnects to those within systems, clusters, and
data centers. Leaders in industry and academia attend the conference to
interact with individuals at the forefront of this field.

Our objective is to address the data center networking and the supercomputing
communities. We hope you can join us and benefit not only by the content
but also by the prime networking opportunities this event always offers.
