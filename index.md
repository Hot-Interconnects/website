Hot Interconnects Symposium August 19-20, 2020 (Tutorials August 21, 2020) at [QCT](https://www.qct.io/), San Jose, CA in 2020!

Join us for our 27th year of an information packed three day symposium about the latest in high performance interconnects. IEEE Hot Interconnects is the premier international forum for researchers and developers of state of the art hardware and software architectures and implementations for interconnection networks of all scales, ranging from multi-core on-chip interconnects to those within systems, clusters, and data centers.

Two days of technical sessions and a day of tutorials are waiting for you, to keep you on the top of the latest developments in industry and academia.
