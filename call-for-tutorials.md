Hot Interconnects 2020 continues its tradition to offer world-class tutorials held by internationally renowned experts in the area of high-performance interconnect networks.

## Scope

Attendees will come from mixed backgrounds and interests in interconnection networks. We encourage tutorials of broad applicability rather than those focusing solely on research in a limited domain or by a particular group. Areas of interest for tutorials include but are not limited to:

- High performance computing networking
- Ethernet networking
- Software defined networking
- Data Center/Cloud and WAN networking
- Optical interconnects
- Emerging interconnect architectures
- High-speed packet processing engines and network processors
- System-on-Chip interconnects
- Traffic engineering and Network analytics
- Equipment

Hot Interconnects will provide Internet access and rooms with standard presentation equipment. Hands-on tutorials must be prepared to rely on laptops brought by the participants.

## Review Process

Tutorial submissions will be reviewed by the Hot Interconnects 2020 tutorials committee. The committee will consider, among other aspects, appropriateness and utility for Hot Interconnects tutorial audience, timeliness and general interest, clarity, completeness, cohesiveness of the proposal and presentation history and teaching/speaking experience of the presenters.
