Hot Interconnects 2021 continues its tradition to offer world-class
tutorials held by internationally renowned experts in the area of
high-performance interconnect networks.

## Scope

Attendees will come from mixed backgrounds and interests in
interconnection networks. We encourage tutorials of broad

limited domain or by a particular group. Areas of interest for
tutorials include but are not limited to:

- DPU and smartNICs
- High performance computing networking
- Ethernet networking
- Software defined networking

## Review Process

Tutorial submissions will be reviewed by the Hot Interconnects 2021
tutorials committee. The committee will consider, among other aspects,
appropriateness and utility for Hot Interconnects tutorial audience,
timeliness and general interest, clarity, completeness, cohesiveness
of the proposal and presentation history and teaching/speaking
experience of the presenters.
