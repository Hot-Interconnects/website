**Title:** Managing the fabrics underpinning AI infrastructure

**Abstract:** 
<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0em;">
As an industry we often oscillate between two extremes; loosely coupled, heterogeneous, robust infrastructure with limited failure domains on one end; tightly coupled, monolithic and homogenous infrastructure with a system wide blast radius on the other. This pattern has manifested in high-performance compute with today’s AI/ML infrastructure exhibiting homogeneity and a lack of robustness in the pursuit of maximized performance. The real-world implications on connectivity management for scale-up approaches in contrast with scale-out technology adds another dimension of consideration for operators.
<br>
This talk will explore today’s embedded and management software approaches to these infrastructures and will discuss the evolution of this stack going forward to facilitate more robust heterogeneous architectures whilst preserving optimal performance and user experience.
