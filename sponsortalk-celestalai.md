**Title:** Photonic Fabric: Optical Scale-Up Networks for Accelerated Computing

**Abstract:** 
<div style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0em;">
As large AI models with reasoning capabilities and new paradigms like inference-time compute and agentic AI proliferate, traditional data center infrastructure is strained to its limits. The fundamental unit of compute is evolving from a few XPUs in a server to tens of XPUs in a rack to a cluster of thousands of XPUs across multiple racks. Traditional copper-based interconnects are reaching their limits and are unable to scale without incurring excessive power and costs.
<br>
The Photonic Fabric™ is a revolutionary optical interconnect technology for scale-up networks that enables continued scaling in AI data center compute by delivering very high bandwidth at nano-second latencies with in-network high-performance, high capacity memory and in-network computing.
<br>
In this presentation, we will talk about Photonic Fabric technology and how optical connectivity chiplets and scale-up system products based on the Photonic Fabric can deliver the next generation of AI infrastructure.
